### A Bash script that automates the backup of a file
This script [automatedBackup.sh](https://github.com/husseinalamutu/devops_hands-on/blob/main/bashScripting/automatedBackup.sh) is just a simple script that showcases 
how to backup a file from one folder to another. While this script illustrates the backup of a file to the same local machine, same concept can be used to backup
to a cloud storage or cloud drive like google, I might add a script to do that later and update this if I do.

### How it works?

This script is interactive, when run on your local machine, it asks you for the full path of the file you want to backup and where to. 
Make sure to include the fullpath to the file and where the backup will be stored.
