### A script that automates the conversion of a file from one format or type to another, in this case pdf to txt.

### How it works?
This script can convert multiple pdf files to txt, all you need to do is to move the files you want to convert to a folder or directory.
When you run the script, it will ask for your input, type in the directory path to where the pdfs files are. 
The script automatically iterates through all pdf files just include /*.pdf after the full path to the directory 
tha contains the files i.e Documents/*.pdf
