### A bash script thas showcase the process of renaming a file automatically

### How it works
It is a simple script that can be used to rename a file, when you run the script it asks for your the file you want to rename, here, 
include the full path to the file i.e Documents/fileOldName.txt.
Next, it asks for the new name you want to give it, don't forget to include the full path also, i.e Documents/fileNewName.txt.
And that's it.
