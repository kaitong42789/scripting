# devops_hands-on
A repository that contains practical hands-on exercises related to Cloud and DevOps. I will be sharing different practical tasks here and also include their solutions along with a link to the article that serves as the step by step guide to the solution.

In the nearest future, I might consider open-sourcing it for others to contribute also. Meanwhile, If you have any collaboration, project or task idea in mind, you can e-mail me at [HUSSEIN](mailto:husseinalamutu@gmail.com)
